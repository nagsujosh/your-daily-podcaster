## Why I Built This

I care deeply about staying informed—on global events, political developments, technological breakthroughs, and stories from home. But the reality is, I rarely make time to sit down and read the news. As an international student in the U.S., I often find myself wanting to keep up with what’s happening both here and back home—yet between classes, projects, and the general pace of life, I just don’t.

The truth is, I don’t reach for The New York Times or scroll through the BBC or WSJ. I might want to, but I don’t. The habit never formed.

What I do have is a daily rhythm: time at the gym, time on the squash court, moments between sets or warming up—time when my mind is open and my hands are free. That’s when I realized what I actually needed: not another app, not another subscription—just a voice telling me what’s going on in the world.

That’s what sparked this project.

**yourDailyPodcaster** is my answer to a problem I couldn’t solve through willpower: staying informed without stopping. It’s a fully automated pipeline that scrapes trustworthy sources, summarizes key stories using AI, converts them into clean, human-like audio, and publishes it to Spotify as a daily podcast. No scrolling, no searching—just press play.
